    <p><em>It was a dark and stormy night...</em></p>
    <p>Todd, the most famous TA of all time, was on his way to get pizza. He decided to go to Punky Pizzas, the best place to get pizza in his town.
         Todd arrived to Punky Pizzas.  You could see the flashing "OPEN" sign on the door reflecting off of the wet pavement.
        Todd sprinted full force to the front door to avoid as much rain as possible. He opened the door to enter but no one seemed to be inside...
    </p>
    <p><strong>*Thud!*</strong> <br> The loud bang echoed through the deserted pizzeria. Todd began to scan the room
        for the source of the noise. He walked slowly to the back of the restaurant. The OPEN sign in the window was humming
        as it began to flicker on and off as he approached the kitchen door. Todd stopped short as his shoe was sticking to something.
        Looking down he saw a stream of neon red liquid spilling out from under the door.
        With a deep breath he opened the door.
